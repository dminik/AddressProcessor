A junior developer was tasked with writing a reusable implementation for a mass mailing application (the 
AddressProcessing project) to read and write text files that hold tab separated data. They proceeded and 
as a result produced the CSVReaderWriter class which can be found in the "Exercise" solution in the 
"AddressProcessing.CSV" namespace.
The implementation, although it works and meets the needs of the application, is of very low quality.

Your task:
	 - Identify and annotate the shortcomings in the current implementation as if you were doing a code 
	   review, using comments in the CSVReaderWriterForAnnotation.cs file.
	 - Refactor the CSVReaderWriter implementation into clean, elegant, rock-solid & well performing 
	   code, without over-engineering. You are not required to update the AddressFileProcessor as part of
	   this task.
	 - Where you make trade offs, comment & explain why.
	 - Assume this code is in production and backwards compatibility must be maintained. Therefore if you 
	   decide to change the public interface, please deprecate the existing methods. Feel free to evolve 
	   the code in other ways though (hint: unit tests will help here).
	 - You'll notice there are some other files in the solution that aren't relevant (v2.IMailShot, 
	   AddressRecord) - ignore those for now. They'll come into play at a later stage in the interview process.
	 - Make sure that the code can be built using the included build.bat. It depends on msbuild/csc and nuget
	   being on the path so make sure you're opening a visual studio command prompt or have it on the path. 
	 - Please don't change the existing .csproj filenames - it will break our automated build.
	 - You can add projects as you see fit as long as everything will build on our systems without manual 
	   intervention. We'll kick off the build through build.bat
	 - Stick to .NET 4.5 and a VS2013 based solution.
	 - You may introduce nuget based references to mocking or testing frameworks but do not include postsharp 
		   or other proprietary dependencies.
	 - If you need a copy of visual studio you can use the free Visual Studio 2013 Community edition. 
	   This edition and other options are available to download from: http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
